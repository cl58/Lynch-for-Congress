But, the fight for affordable health care for all is not over yet.  While ACA drastically increased the number of citizens with health insurance, private insurance agencies still control much of the industry.  Following in the footsteps of numerous other countries, the United States needs to shift to a single payer system in which <i>all</i> citizens have access to basic healthcare needs.  The system would ensure that each citizen is able to make his or her own decisions on their doctors and healthcare needs and that government would not interfere with doctors' relationships with patients.

Central to the prevention of violent crimes is a new outlook on gun congrol.  But, fear not gun enthusiasts.  The government does not wish to outlaw gun ownership, only to change policies to more sensible and safe ones.  We need to pass legislation setting strict, uniform standards for background checks.  Only citizens who can prove that they can be a responsible gun owner should be permitted to buy guns.  Further, assault weapons are simply unnecessary for the general public and cause more harm than good, necessitating stricter control of them.  Further, standard guidelines for gun use and storage should be made known to all gun owners to prevent accidental use of guns by those not prepared to use them, including children.  A logical, sensible perspective on gun control is all that is needed to potentially save countless innocent lives each year.</p>">Learn More</a>

                                <a href="#" class="btn btn-light" data-featherlight="<h2>Women's Equality</h2><h3>Pay Equity</h3><p>Despite the great advances women have had in society over the past century, women and men are simply not treated equally when it comes to pay.  With equal education, experience, qualifications, men are paid more than women.  This affects all women harshly, but especially single mothers, and women in low-income jobs who are not able to afford the cost of living as easily as their male counterparts.  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 was useful in helping lessen the wage gap, but more aggressive action must be taken to stop the problem before it happens, and we will work tirelessly toward that.</p><h3>Women's Health</h3><p>All women should be afforded the basic right to adequate reproductive health and education. Young women in schools should be given a quality, holistic education on their reproductive system and reproductive health.  Further, women of all ages should have ready access to over-the-counter contraception.  Finally, pregnant women must be given access to proper medical advice by continuing funding for Planned Parenthood, and similar organizations.</p><h3>The Right to Choose</h3><p>The right to terminate a pregnancy is a decision made between a woman and her doctor.  It is not the place of the government to regulate what a woman does with her own body and we will fight to stop the vicious attacks against that right.</p><h3>Violence Against Women</h3><p>The epidemic of violence against women in our country must be stopped. Women are subject to increased risk of domestic violence, sexual assualt, and sexual harassment due only to their gender.  We must resolve to prevent violence against women before it occurs and must not forget the victims of domestic and sexual violence by providng the medical and mental health services necessary and working hard to ensure that they are given the justice they deserve in the court system.</p>">Learn More</a>

Hodges</i> ensured that all citizens regardless of gender and sexual orientation would have the right to get married. We cannot turn on backs on the LGBTQ community yet, however. We must continue to ensure that members of the community are not discriminated against in society or the workplace and we must ensure that they are afforded <b>all</b> of the same rights as opposite-sex couples in every state across the US.</p><h3>Racial Equality</h3><p>Across the United States, it is the unfortunate truth that African Americans are still subjecto to discrimination based on their race.  One of this campaign's strongest beliefs is that no person should be treated differently based on who they are.  We will support any and all legislation that pertains to economic and civil justice for the African American and other minority communities in this country.  A criminal justice system that treats different classes of people differently is inherently un-democratic and we must fight to make all citizens equal.</p><h3>Voting Rights</h3><p>The right of all eligible citizens to vote must never be infringed upon by the government.  We will work to fight against all measures taken to restrict citizens from voting, including Voter ID laws and any other restrictive measure.</p>">Learn More</a>
